# YOLO - Object detection

NOTE: This is not a whole YOLO-based object detection project, but rather the neural networks' architectures involved and few other utility functions. 

Here you can find the Darknet53 architecture from Yolov3, as well as the CSPDarknet53 model from Yolov4. CSPDarknet53 with SPP is currently in progress. All the work has been caried out with PyTorch.
