# YOLO - Object detection

NOTE: This is not a whole YOLO-based object detection project, but rather the neural networks' architectures involved and few other utility functions. 

Here you can find the Darknet53 architecture from Yolov3, CSPDarknet53 model, CSPDarknet53 with SPP and CSPDarknet53 with SPP and PA from Yolov4. All the work has been caried out with PyTorch.

SPP = Spatial Pyramid Pooling \
PA  = Path aggregation
